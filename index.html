                <p>I graduated from the University of Denver in 2020 with a BA in International Studies and Philosophy, and minors in 
                        Arabic and Religous Studies. And then...I did an MA specializing in Quantitative Analysis/Data Science? Correct! After realizing my passion for data while
                        studying abroad in Zurich, Switzerland, working for 
                            <a class = "c2" href= "http://www.kai-gehring.net/publications.php" >Dr.Kai Gehring</a>,
                        I became set on pursuing a career related to data science, data visualization, and machine learning.

                <p> Currently, I work for HP - previously Poly, until acquired in November 2022. One of my favorite projects I worked on while at Poly was conducting natural 
                    language processing on customer service tickets utilizing the BERT algorithm. While working on this project, I worked in a multi-developer environment within 
                    Gitlab, used AWS S3, EC2, and Lambda functions for data management, as well as wrote CI/CD for the project, conducted unit testing, and refactored code. 
                    Perhaps my favorite aspect of this project was working with a much more senior data scientist; I learned more working with him than I ever could have even expected. 
                    Other aspects of this position include jointly supporting Pricing Strategy and Data Science teams, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques to address 
                    business problems, performing data engineering tasks to automate data flows, and build dashboards to support decision-making, and partnering with stakeholders to 
                    identify requirements and deliverables.

                        as a regulatory affairs intern. While working there, I was able to a work in R's Shiny package, and create a
